##### void I2C_init(void)
This function needs to be called only once to set up the correct SCL frequency
for the bus

##### uint8_t I2C_start(uint8_t address)
This function needs to be called any time a connection to a new slave device should
be established. The function returns 1 if an error has occurred, otherwise it returns
0.

The syntax to start a operation write to a device is either:
`I2C_start(SLAVE_ADDRESS+I2C_WRITE);`
or
`I2C_start(SLAVE_WRITE_ADDRESS);`

The syntax to start a read operation from a device is either:
`I2C_start(SLAVE_ADDRESS+I2C_READ);`
or
`I2C_start(SLAVE_READ_ADDRESS);`

##### uint8_t I2C_write(uint8_t data)
This function is used to write data to the currently active device.
The only parameter this function takes is the 8 bit unsigned integer to be sent.
The function returns 1 if an error has occurred, otherwise it returns
0.

##### uint8_t I2C_read_ack(void)
This function is used to read one byte from a device and request another byte of data
after the transmission is complete by sending the acknowledge bit.
This function returns the received byte.

##### uint8_t I2C_read_nack(void)
This function is used to read one byte from a device an then not requesting another
byte and therefore stopping the current transmission.
This function returns the received byte.

##### uint8_t i2c_transmit(uint8_t address, uint8_t* data, uint16_t length);
This function is used to transmit [length] number of bytes to an I2C device with the given
I2C address from [data].
The [address] passed to this function is the 7-bit slave address, left
shifted by one bit (i.e. 7-bit slave address is `0x2F` -> `(0x2F)<<1` = `0x5E`)

##### uint8_t i2c_receive(uint8_t address, uint8_t* data, uint16_t length);
This function is used to read [length] number of bytes from the I2C device with the given
I2C address into the [data].
The [address] passed to this function is the 7-bit slave address, left
shifted by one bit (i.e. 7-bit slave address is `0x2F` -> `(0x2F)<<1` = `0x5E`)

##### void I2C_stop(void)
This function disables the TWI peripheral completely
and therefore disconnects the device from the bus.
