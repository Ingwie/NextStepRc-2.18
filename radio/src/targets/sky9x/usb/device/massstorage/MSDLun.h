/// \unit
/// !Purpose
/// 
/// Logical Unit Number (LUN) used by the Mass Storage driver and the SCSI
/// protocol. Represents a logical hard-drive.
/// 
/// !Usage
/// -# Initialize Memory related pins (see pio & board.h).
/// -# Initialize a Media instance for the LUN (see memories).
/// -# Initlalize the LUN with LUN_Init, and link to the initialized Media.
/// -# To read data from the LUN linked media, uses LUN_Read.
/// -# To write data to the LUN linked media, uses LUN_Write.
/// -# To unlink the media, uses LUN_Eject.
